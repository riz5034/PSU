    <p>The Vinyl cutting team has gathered together to built a working site for QAD. To do so we shall use the amazon web service to build a site using the tools it possesses such as the LambdaTM, DynamoDBTM, and CognitoTM. Each of them filling in for a nessesary position in the construction of the site, from the login to the orders. Using our lessons from school we've built a site that fufills all that the customers and employers will need while still retaining its fexibility to grow larger if need be. It started with building a site and then having it store data valueables and accounts, with those done all we needed was to build the site around them. sooon we expanded into building the other pages. Along the way we had to solve issues with minor things such as the lost password function and getting the propper feedback from the variosu tools. but we persevered and built a site we can be proud of. </p>
    <p>With this site we made it so one can order various products like stickers, decals, or small messages that can be places where-ever one wishes to. these proffesionally cut designs will look impressive and project a feeling of professional reliability. the site is also the best it can get in terms of like-ability as it is fast and streamlined in termsof use and check out. afterall nobody wants to be stuck searching a site for what you want. </p>
